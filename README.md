# Neon Mosh ðŸŒŒ

## About The Project

So, I made a fictional restaurant page called Neon Mosh. It's all about that apocalyptic, retro synthwave vibe, which is something I am personally obsessed with. It turned out way better than I had initially expected. I was a bit slow when it came to setting up the workspace and getting all of the logic in place but I pulled through (thankfully)

## Webpack Plugins Used

Alright, these were the basic plugins I used, along with Webpack and Webpack Cli. Here's the lowdown on the plugins:

- **[HtmlWebpackPlugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/)**: This sets up HTML files for the bundles. Super handy and saves a ton of time. ðŸš€

- **[css-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/)**: This one deals with all the CSS stuff. It takes those `@import` and `url()` things and sorts them out. ðŸŽ¨

- **[style-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/)**: After css-loader does its thing, style-loader steps in. It takes all that CSS and slaps it right into the webpage. ðŸ’¥

That's the gist of it. (Hope it helped) ðŸŒ
